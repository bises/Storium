# Storium (Monorepo)

Monorepo skeleton for the Storium app.

Structure:
- packages/backend — Fastify + TypeScript API stub
- packages/mobile — React Native app stub (TypeScript)
- packages/shared — shared types/utilities

Quick commands:
- `pnpm install` — install dependencies
- `pnpm -w -r run dev` — run dev scripts (once configured per package)

This repository is a starting point; features, DB, and CI will be added next.
